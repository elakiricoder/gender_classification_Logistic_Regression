# gender_classification_Logistic_Regression
A made up dataset for the absolute beginners to understand the Logistic Regression.

This is a dataset I made to start with the Logistic regression. The data is clean and it can be directly applied to the Machine Learning without having to deal with the data cleaning and visualizations. 

The notebook file is also attached with simple explanation on how to perform classification tasks using the simple Logistic Regression model. 

This dataset is just a made up one and the features are just approximate values. Although the data is not real, I arrived most of the features based on the real scenarios.
